### Keyboard remapping app for Windows

This is a streamlined reimplementation of [randyrants/SharpKeys](https://github.com/randyrants/sharpkeys), released under the same license.

It maps keypress events from one keyboard key to another, using the Windows registry setting "Scancode Map" at System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layout.

This setting applies to all users and requires administrator privileges. Registry updates take effect the next time a user signs in to Windows.
